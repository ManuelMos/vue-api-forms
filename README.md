# vue-api-forms

## Basic Idea
Automate user interface generation for searching and maintaining data based on a configuraton.
Formats like OpenAPI or RAML will be supported. Also writing your own format wrapper is an option.

Different datatypes can be mapped to components of your desired UI framework. 
There are no limitations on UI frameworks planned. Every UI framework should work.
With different hooks and attributes you are able to customize the visualization of your endpoints.
